A shopfront
The project will start as a database whereby:

as an administrator, you can add products, which consist of an id, a price and a stock.
as a regular user you can buy 1 of the products.
as the owner you can make payments or withdraw value from the contract.
Eventually, you will refactor it to include:

ability to remove products.
co-purchase by different people.
add merchants akin to what Amazon has become.
add the ability to pay with a third-party token.
A prediction market

Eventually, you will refactor it to include:
